## Length of a 3D Vector

The length (magnitude) of a 3-dimensional vector \( \vec{v} = (x, y, z) \) can be found using:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

### Example

Consider a particle with an acceleration vector that is \(30^\circ\) below the horizontal, with a magnitude of \(6 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\).

The horizontal and vertical components are calculated as:
\[
x = -a \cos(30^\circ)
\]
\[
y = -a \sin(30^\circ)
\]
Given \(a = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2\), the acceleration vector in Cartesian form is:
\[
\vec{a} = (-5.2, -3.0) \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

## Cartesian Unit Vectors

The Cartesian unit vectors are:
- \( \mathbf{i} \) for the x-axis
- \( \mathbf{j} \) for the y-axis
- \( \mathbf{k} \) for the z-axis

### Expressing Vectors in Unit Vector Form

Any vector \( \vec{v} \) can be expressed in terms of the unit vectors:
\[
\vec{v} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k}
\]

## Adding Vectors

To add two vectors, simply add their respective components. For example:
\[
(3\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j}) + (-1\mathbf{i} + 1\mathbf{j}) = (2\mathbf{i} + 3\mathbf{j})
\]

## Multiplying Vectors

### 1. Dot Product

The dot product of two vectors \( \vec{a} \) and \( \vec{b} \) is denoted as:
\[
c = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}
\]
The result of the dot product is a **scalar** and can be calculated as:
\[
c = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \cos(\theta)
\]
where:
- \( |\vec{a}| \) and \( |\vec{b}| \) are the magnitudes of vectors \( \vec{a} \) and \( \vec{b} \)
- \( \theta \) is the angle between the two vectors when placed tail to tail

We can also compute the dot product by multiplying the components of both vectors

$$ c = \vec{a}_x \vec{b}_x + \vec{a}_y \vec{b}_y + \vec{a}_z \vec{b}_z $$ 

### 2. Cross Multiplication

The cross product is denoted as:
\[
c = \vec{a} \times \vec{b}
\]

#### Magnitude

The result of the cross product is a **vector**
We can calculate the magnitude with:

$$ |\vec{c}| = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \sin(\theta) $$

#### Direction

The direction of $\vec{c}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$

As there are two possible perpendicular vectors to $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ we need to decide which is correct

We will decide a starting vector and if the angle $\theta$ between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ turns in the anticlockwise direction the direction of the vector is up in relation to the plane

#### Properties

Cross multiplication is anticommutitive

$$\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = -\vec{b} \times \vec{b} $$

If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{a}$ are parallel the cross product will be $0$

If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{a}$ are perpendicular  the cross product will be:
$$  |\vec{a}| \times |\vec{b}| = \vec{a}\vec{b}$$

This can be used to compute the cross products of the unit vectors without having to do a calculation

#### Shortcuts

$$ \vec{i} = (\vec{A}_j\vec{B}_k - \vec{A}_j\vec{B}_k) $$

For calculating $\vec{j}$ and $vec{k}$ we just need to swap the symbols in the equation according to

$$ \vec{i} => \vec{j} => \vec{k} => \vec{i} $$
