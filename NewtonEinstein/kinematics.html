Lecture: Kinematics

---

For kinematics in 2d we need to define the velocity in terms of vectors
$$\vec{v} = \frac{dx}{dt}\vec{i} + \frac{dx}{dt}\vec{j} $$

### Circular motion:

#### Uniform cicular motion

We describe the position of a particle with circular motion with polar coordinates

With constant angular velocity we can define velocity as:
$$v = r \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
$$v = r \omega $$

As the vector constantly changes direction there is an acceleration called centripetal acceleration

$$ \vec{a} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{vd\theta}{dt} = v\omega$$ 

#### Non uniform circular motion

If the magnitude of the velocity changes over time there must be a component of the acceleration that is parallel
to the velocity vector

To find the tangential acceleration we can use:

$$ a_t = r \alpha $$
Where $\alpha$ is $\frac{d\omega}{dt}$
