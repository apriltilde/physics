### Polar Coordinates

We can write any vector in polar coordinates:

Cartesian form:
$$ \vec{r} = x\vec{i} + y\vec{j} $$
Polar form:
$$ \vec{r} = rsin{\theta}\vec{i} + rsin{\theta}\vec{j} $$

#### Planes

The unit vectors for plane polar coordinates are:

$\vec{r}$ is the unit vector in the direction of r 
$\vec{\theta}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\theta$


### Spherical Coordinates

We define sphherical coordinates by:

- $r$ the distance from the center of the earth

- $\theta$ the angle between North and the line ${r}$

- and the angle $\phi$ which is the angle between East and the line ${r}$

We would commonly call $\phi$ longitude and  $(90 - \theta)$ latitude


#### Unit Vectors

We define

$\vec{r}$ as "up" relative to the observer
$\vec{\theta}$ as North to South
$\vec{\phi}$ as East

### Cyclindrical Coordinates

We define:

$\vec{z}$ which is the distance between a point \vec{o} and the start of the vector
Then we can use polar coordinates as a slice of a cylinder is a circle
