Lecture: Conservation of momentum and energy

---

### Momentum

$$\frac{dp}{dt} = F_{net}$$
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = m \frac{dv}{dt} + v\frac{dm}{dt}$$

If m is constant
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = ma $$

#### Conservative forces

The work done by a conservative force is independent of the path taken
$$ W_c = -\Delta PE $$

$$ F_s = -\frac{dU}{ds}$$

#### Non conservative forces

For non conservative forces we need to define an isolated system to use conservation of energy
