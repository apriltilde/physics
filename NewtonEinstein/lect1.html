Lecture: Vectors

---

We can find the length of a 3 dimensional vector with

$$ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} $$

Example :

We have a particle with an acceleration vector 30 degrees below the horizontal with a magnitude of $ 6ms^{-2} $
$$ x = -a * cos(30) $$
$$ y = -a * sin(30) $$
$$ a = (-5.2, -3.0) $$


The cartesian unit vectors are: 
	i, j , k

Any vector can be expressed in the unit vector form

To add two vectors we just need to add their components together
$$ (3i + 2j) + (-1i + 1j) = (2i + 3j) $$

To multiply two vectors together we have two options

Dot product: 

$$ c = a . b $$
The dot product will give us a scalar
$$ c  = abcos{\theta} $$
Where a and b are both the magnitudes of their respective vectors and $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors a and b placed tail to tail
