## Length of a 3D Vector

The length (magnitude) of a 3-dimensional vector \( \vec{v} = (x, y, z) \) can be found using:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

### Example

Consider a particle with an acceleration vector that is \(30^\circ\) below the horizontal, with a magnitude of \(6 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\).

The horizontal and vertical components are calculated as:
\[
x = -a \cos(30^\circ)
\]
\[
y = -a \sin(30^\circ)
\]
Given \(a = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2\), the acceleration vector in Cartesian form is:
\[
\vec{a} = (-5.2, -3.0) \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

## Cartesian Unit Vectors

The Cartesian unit vectors are:
- \( \mathbf{i} \) for the x-axis
- \( \mathbf{j} \) for the y-axis
- \( \mathbf{k} \) for the z-axis

### Expressing Vectors in Unit Vector Form

Any vector \( \vec{v} \) can be expressed in terms of the unit vectors:
\[
\vec{v} = x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k}
\]

## Adding Vectors

To add two vectors, simply add their respective components. For example:
\[
(3\mathbf{i} + 2\mathbf{j}) + (-1\mathbf{i} + 1\mathbf{j}) = (2\mathbf{i} + 3\mathbf{j})
\]

## Multiplying Vectors

### 1. Dot Product

The dot product of two vectors \( \vec{a} \) and \( \vec{b} \) is denoted as:
\[
c = \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}
\]
The result of the dot product is a **scalar** and can be calculated as:
\[
c = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \cos(\theta)
\]
where:
- \( |\vec{a}| \) and \( |\vec{b}| \) are the magnitudes of vectors \( \vec{a} \) and \( \vec{b} \)
- \( \theta \) is the angle between the two vectors when placed tail to tail
