Lecture: Distributions and Averages

---

### The normal distribution

The normal distribution is given by

$$ f(z) = e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}} $$
$$ z = \frac{e}{\sigma} $$

Where $ e $ is the true mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

Taking the integral of a gaussian within rannge $a$, $b$ gives the probabilty of your value being between $a$, $b$


### Standard deviations

$$ \sigma(x + y) = \sqrt{(\sigma^2(x) + \sigma^2(y)} $$

For small samples $\sigma$ can become biased. To remove the bias we multiply the variance by
$$ \frac{N}{N - 1} $$
