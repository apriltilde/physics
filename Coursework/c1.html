## Question 1

**(A)** An object moves along the \(x\)-axis with velocity \(v_x\) at time \(t\) given by:

\[
v_x = A t + B t^2
\]

where \(A = 6.0 \, \text{ms}^{-2}\) and \(B = -1.0 \, \text{ms}^{-3}\).

(i) Assuming that the object is located at the origin at \(t = 0 \, \text{s}\), deduce expressions for the position \(x\) and acceleration \(a_x\) of the object at time \(t\)
.Use the expression above and the two you have deduced to calculate values of \(x\), \(v_x\), and \(a_x\) at \(t = 0, 3\), and \(6 \, \text{s}\).

#### Solution :

The acceleration \( a_x \) is the derivative of velocity with respect to time:
$$ a_x = \frac{dv}{dt} $$
$$ = A - 2Bt $$
$$ = 6.0 - 2.0t $$
<br>
The position \( x \) is obtained by integrating the velocity equation:
$$ x = \int A t + B t^2 \ dt$$
$$ x = \frac{1}{2} At ^2 + \frac{1}{3}B t ^3 + c$$
We know when $t = 0$ that $x = 0$ therefore $c = 0$
$$ x = 3.0t^2 - \frac{1}{3}t^3$$
<br>
When $t = 0 : \ \ $ $a_x = 6.0{ms}^{-2} \ \ $ $v_x = 0.0{ms}^{-1} \ \ $ $ x = 0.0m $

When $t = 3 : \ \ $ $a_x = 0.0{ms}^{-2} \ \ $ $v_x = 9.0{ms}^{-1} \ \ $ $ x = 18.0m $

When $t = 6 : \ \ $ $a_x = -6.0{ms}^{-2} \ \ $ $v_x = 0.0{ms}^{-1} \ \ $ $ x = 36.0m $
</div>
(ii) Sketch stacked graphs of the velocity \(v_x\) and acceleration \(a_x\) of the object in the time interval \(0 < t < 6 \, \text{s}\).
