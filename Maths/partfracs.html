Lecture: Partial Fractions

---

Consider the following:
$$ \frac{1}{a + x}+\frac{1}{b - x} $$
$$ \frac{a + b}{(a + x)(b - x)}$$
$$ \frac{a + b}{ab + (b - a)x - x^2} $$

### Example 1 :

#### Method 1 :

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)} $$

We want to write this equation as partial fractions

$$ let\  f(x) = \frac{a}{x - 1} + \frac{b}{x - 2} + \frac{c}{x - 3} $$

We can start by multiplying by all the denominators to get one fraction

We want to compare the numerators between the original $f(x)$ with the combined fraction

$$ 1 = a(x - 2)(x - 3) + b(x - 1)(x - 3) + c(x - 1)(x - 2) $$

To find the values $a$, $b$ and $c$ by evaluating at x = 1
$$ let \  x = 1 \implies (x - 1) = 0$$
$$ 1 = a(1 - 2)(1 - 3) \implies a = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$ let \ x = 2 \implies (x - 2) = 0$$
$$ 1 = b(2 - 1)(2 - 3) \implies b = -1$$

we can continue for c as well

therefore $f(x)$ can be written as a partial fraction

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2(x - 1)} - \frac{1}{x - 2} + \frac{1}{2(x - 3)} $$

#### Method 2 :

We can expand 
$$ 1 = a(x - 2)(x - 3) + b(x - 1)(x - 3) + c(x - 1)(x - 2) $$
to get:
$$ 1 = (a + b + c)x^2 + (-5a - 4b - 3c)x + (-6a + 3b + 2c) $$

We now have three simultanius equations to solve to find the unknown values $a$, $b$ and $c$

### Example 2 :

$$ g(x) = \frac{1}{x^3 - 1}$$

We know that $x = 1$ is a root of the cubic so we can factorise $g(x)$
$$(x - 1)(\alpha x^2 + \beta x + \gamma) $$

We can find the unknown values as all being 1

$$ (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) $$

The quadratic is unsolvable with real numbers 

Therefore we shall write one of the partial fractions with the quadratic as the denominator. To find the partial fractions we can compare numerators again

$$ 1 = a(x^2 + x + 1) + b(x - 1) $$

This equation implies:
$$ a = 0 $$
$$ a + b = 0 \implies b = 0 $$
$$ 1 = a - b$$
This is a contradiction so cannot be valid

#### Valid solution 

We can instead write the partial fractions as
$$ \frac{a}{x - 1} + \frac{bx + c}{x^2 + x + 1}$$
$$ 1 = a(x^2 + x + 1) + (bx + c)(x - 1) $$

This gives us
$$a = \frac{1}{3}, b = -\frac{1}{3}, c = -\frac{2}{3}$$

We can then write the partial fractions with these values

### Example 3 :
$$ h(x) = \frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)^2} $$

Just expanding normally will not work as not all unknowns are independent from each other

Therefore we need to exapnd and can write it as:
$$ \frac{a}{x - 1} + \frac{bx + c}{x^2 + 1} $$
$$ 1 = a(x^2 + 1)^2 + (bx + c)(x - 1) $$

From this we can find the unknown values to find the partial fraction
$$ \frac{1}{4(x - 1)} - \frac{x + 3}{4(x + 1)^2} $$

We can write $x + 3$ as $ (x + 1) + 2$ to simplfy 

#### Alternate solution

$$ \frac{a}{x - 1} + \frac{b}{x + 1} + \frac{c}{(x + 1)^2} $$
