Lecture: Complex numbers

---

### Definitions

Consider a quadratic we cannot solve with real roots

$$x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0$$
$$ x = 1 \pm  \sqrt{-1} $$
 
As $\sqrt{-1}$ is not real we need to define it

$$ i = \sqrt{-1} $$

We write complex numbers with an imaginary and real part

$$z = a + bi$$

#### Algebra

We have functions to find the real and imaginary parts

$$ Re(z) = a $$
$$ Im(z) = b $$

Addition of complex numbers:
$$ z_1 + z_2 = a_1 + a_2 + i(b_1 + b_2) $$

Mulitplication of complex numbers:

$$ z_1 \times z_2 = (a_1 + ib_1)(a_2 + ib_2)$$
$$ = a_1a_2 - b_1b_2 + i(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)$$

Division of complex numbers :
$$ \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{a_1 + ib_1}{a_2 + ib_2}$$
$$\frac{a_1 + ib_1}{a_2 + ib_2} \times \frac{a_2 - ib_2}{a_2 - ib_2}$$
$$ = \frac{a_1 a_2 + b_1b_2 + i(a_2b_1 - a_1b_2)}{a_2^2 + b_2^2}$$

Example:

$$\frac{5 + i}{1 - i} \times \frac{1 + i}{1 + i}$$
$$ = \frac{5 + i + 5i -1}{2} = 2 + 3i$$


#### Complex conjugate

The complex conjugate of a complex number $z$ is $z^* = a - bi$

$$ z z^* = (a + bi)(a - bi)$$
$$ = a^2 + b^2 $$
$$ |z| = \sqrt{z z^*}$$

We can use the complex conjugate to define the $Re(z)$ function and the $Im(z)$ function
$$ Re(z) = \frac{1}{2}(z + z^*) $$
$$ Im(z) = \frac{1}{2i}(z - z^*)$$

We can show that 
$$ (z_1 + z_2)^* = z_1^* + z_2^*$$
$$ (z_1  z_2)^* = z_1^*  z_2^*$$

Using this we can prove that if $z$ is the root of the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ then so is $z^*$

$$ az^2 + bz + c = 0 $$
$$(az^2 + bz + c)^* = 0 $$
$$ a^*(z^2)^* + b^*z^* + c^* = 0 $$
$$a(z^*)^2 + bz^* + c = 0 $$

#### Polar form

As our complex numbers are $z = a + bi$ we can represent them on a 2D plot called an Argand diagram


We can also represent our complex numbers in their polar forms
$$ z = rcos{\theta} + irsin{\theta} $$

We call $r$ the modulus and $\theta$ as the argument
$$ arg(z) = 0 $$

We will define $\theta$ as 
$$-\pi < \theta \le \pi $$

Example:

Express the roots of $x^2 + 2x + 2 = 0$ in polar form

$$ x = -1 \pm i $$
$$ r = \sqrt{2} $$
$$ arg(-1 \pm i) = \pm \frac{3\pi}{4} $$
$$ x = \sqrt{2}({cos{\frac{3\pi}{4}} + i sin{\frac{3\pi}{4}}}) $$
$$   = \sqrt{2}({cos{\frac{3\pi}{4}} - i sin{\frac{3\pi}{4}}}) $$
