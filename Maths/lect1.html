A polynomial of degree n has the form
$$ P(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dX^3 ... $$
$$ = \sum{0}{n}{ax^i} $$

The polynomial always has n roots where n is the highest power of x

We can write a polynomial as a factor of the polynomial multiplied by a different polynomial of a lower degree

We can also write any polynomial as the product of its factors
$$ (x + a) * (x + b) * (x + c) ... $$

Example: 

$$ f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6 $$
$$ (x - 1) * (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) $$

We need to find a, b , c and d

Method 1 :

$$ ax^4 + (b - a)x^3 + (c - b) + (d - c)x -d $$
Compared to our original polynomial we can figure out the unknown terms

$$ a = 1 $$
$$ b - a = -1 => b = 0 $$
$$ c -b = -7 => c = -7 $$
$$ d - c = 1 => d = -6 $$

$$ (x - 1)(x^3 - 7x - 6) = (x - 1)g(x) $$
$$ g(x) = (x + 1)(ax^2 + bx + c) $$

We can repeat to find the factors of the original quartic polynomial
$$ (x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 2) $$

Method 2 :

Assume we have found one root

$$ (x - 1) * (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) $$
$$ ax^4 + (b - a)x^3 + (c - b) + (d - c)x -d $$

$$ let x = 0 => d = -6 $$

If we take the first derivative of the equation where x = 0 it can help us solve the factors

$$ let x = 0 => d - c = 1 => c = -7 $$

We can continue to derive to find the other unknown terms

Method 3 : 

Divide the quartic by $ (x - 1) $ to find the coefficients

$$ x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6 $$
$$ x^3 (x - 1 ) = x^4 - x^3 $$
$$ x^3 (x - 1) * ( -7x^2 + x - 6 ) = x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6 $$
