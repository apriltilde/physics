## Definition

A polynomial of degree \(n\) has the form:
\[
P(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + \ldots + kx^n
\]
Alternatively, this can be written as:
\[
P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i
\]

### Key Properties
- A polynomial of degree \(n\) always has \(n\) roots (including complex and repeated roots).
- Any polynomial can be expressed as a product of its factors:
\[
(x + a)(x + b)(x + c) \ldots
\]

## Example

Consider the polynomial:
\[
f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6
\]
We can express it as:
\[
(x - 1)(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)
\]
Our goal is to find \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).

### Method 1: Comparing Coefficients

Start by expanding:
\[
(x - 1)(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) = ax^4 + (b - a)x^3 + (c - b)x^2 + (d - c)x - d
\]

Comparing this with the original polynomial \(x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6\), we obtain:

- \(a = 1\)
- \(b - a = -1 \implies b = 0\)
- \(c - b = -7 \implies c = -7\)
- \(d - c = 1 \implies d = -6\)

Thus, the factorization so far is:
\[
(x - 1)(x^3 - 7x - 6)
\]

Next, factor \(g(x) = x^3 - 7x - 6\):
\[
g(x) = (x + 1)(ax^2 + bx + c)
\]

Repeating this process, the complete factorization is:
\[
(x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 2)
\]

### Method 2: Using Derivatives

Given \(x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6 = ax^4 + (b - a)x^3 + (c - b)x^2 + (d - c)x - d\)
- \(x = 0 \implies d = -6\)

Taking the derivative and setting \(x = 0\):
- \(d - c = 1 \implies c = -7\)

Continue deriving and solving to find all coefficients.

### Method 3: Polynomial Division

Divide the original polynomial by \((x - 1)\):

1. Divide \(x^4 - x^3 - 7x^2 + x + 6\) by \(x - 1\):
   - The first term: \(x^3\), multiply \(x^3(x - 1) = x^4 - x^3\)
   - Subtract to obtain the remainder: \(-7x^2 + x - 6\)
   
Continue dividing to obtain all factors:
\[
(x - 1)(x^3 - 7x - 6)
\]
Further factor to get the complete factorization:
\[
(x + 1)(x - 1)(x - 3)(x + 2)
\]
