### Spiral galaxies

$$ G \frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} = m v^2 $$
$$ M = \frac{v^2 r}{G} $$

We can measure $v$ using the Doppler effect.
$$ z = \frac{\lambda - \lambda_0}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c} $$
Where $\lambda_0$ is a laboratory wavelength and $\lambda$ is the observed wavelength.

Of course this only works when the galaxy is edge-on, we also need to take into account the inclination angle $\vartheta$.

As we measure further out from the centre of the galaxy, we expect the velocity to decrease. However, this is not what we observe. Instead, the velocity remains constant. This is evidence for dark matter which makes up the difference.

### Elliptical galaxies

As the motion of stars in elliptical galaxies is random, we can use Doppler broadening to measure the velocity dispersion.

Because an elliptical galaxy is a many stars with random motion their Doppler shifts will be spread out. This causes the Doppler shift of the whole galaxy to be broadened 

$$ \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{RMS of velocity}{c} $$

To find the root mean square of the velocity, we can use the virial theorem.
$$ 2 K + U = 0 $$
$$ KE = \sum_{stars} \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2} M rms(v)^2 $$
$$ U = - \frac{G M^2}{R} $$
$$ 2 \times \frac{1}{2} M rms(v)^2 - \frac{G M^2}{R} = 0 $$
$$ M = \frac{R rms(v)^2}{G} $$

For bright elliptical galaxies.
$$ M = 10 M_(*) $$
Where $M_*$ is the total mass of the luminous matter.
This implies the existence of dark matter.
