### Stefan-Boltzmann Law
$$ F = \sigma T^4 $$

Calculating the surface temperature of the Sun from a measurement on the Earth:
$$ F = \sigma T^4 * \frac{R^2)}{D^2} $$
Where $R$ is the radius of the Sun and $D$ is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

$$ T = \left( \frac{F D^2}{\sigma R^2} \right)^{1/4} $$

### Atmospheric and Albedo Effects

As the earth is a spinning sphere we only receive a quarter of the energy from the sun.

The albedo of an object is the fraction of the light that is reflected by the object. The albedo of the Earth is 0.3.

Therefore the energy absorbed by the Earth from the Sun is:
$$ F = \sigma T^4 * \frac{R^2}{D^2} * \frac{1}{4} * (1 - 0.3) $$
$$ F = 239 W/m^2 $$

We can calculate the temperature of the Earth's surface
$$ T = \left( \frac{F D^2}{\sigma R^2} \right)^{1/4} $$
$$ T = 255 K $$

This is the temperature of the Earth without the greenhouse effect. When we take into account the greenhouse effect the temperature is 288 K.

As the radiation from the Earth is in the infrared range, the greenhouse effect is due to the reflection of infrared radiation by the atmosphere.

Now to calculate the total radiation absorbed by the Earth can be calculated by an infinite series:
$$ F = 240 * sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} = 480 W/m^2 $$
$$ T = 303 K $$

### Scattering of Light

The sky is blue because the blue light is scattered more than the red light. The scattering of light is due to the Rayleigh scattering.

$$ scattering = \frac{1}{\lambda^4} $$

At sunset the sky is red because the light has to travel through more atmosphere and the blue light is scattered out.

Clouds are white because the water droplets are large enough to scatter all the light. This is called Mie scattering which scatters all the light independent of the wavelength.
