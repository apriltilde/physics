Lecture: Scales of the Universe

---

## Astronomical Units

An astronomical unit is the average distance between the Sun and the Earth:
\[
1 \, \text{AU} = 1.5 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}
\]

### Light Travel Time

Using this distance, we can find the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth:
\[
t = \frac{d}{c}
\]
where:
- \(d\) is the distance (1 AU)
- \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\))

Substituting the values:
\[
t \approx 500 \, \text{s}
\]
This means it takes approximately 500 seconds (about 8.3 minutes) for light to reach Earth from the Sun.

## Solar Mass

The mass of the Sun is referred to as one solar mass and is a standard unit for measuring the mass of other celestial bodies.

## Angular Momentum in the Universe

### 1. For an Object's Own Rotation

The angular momentum \(L\) of a rotating object is calculated using:
\[
L = I\omega
\]
where:
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia
- \(\omega\) is the angular velocity

For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is given by:
\[
I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2
\]


### 2. For an Object Rotating Around a Point Mass

To calculate the angular momentum \(L\) of an object rotating around a central point mass:
\[
L = r p
\]
where:
- \(r\) is the distance from the rotation axis
- \(p\) is the linear momentum \(p = mv\)

## Luminosity and Flux of Stars

### Inverse Square Law for Luminosity

The luminosity of a star falls off according to the inverse square law:
\[
F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}
\]
where:
- \(F\) is the flux (the luminosity received per unit area)
- \(L\) is the total luminosity of the star

### Flux

The **flux** is the amount of luminosity received per unit area per second. It's a measure of how bright a star appears from a given distance.

### Angle

We measure angles in arcminutes and arcseconds in astronomy.

An arcminute is defined as $\frac{1}{60}$ of a degree

A parsec is the distance at which 1AU subtends 1 arsecond
