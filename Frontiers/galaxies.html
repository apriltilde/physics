### Hubble's Classification of Galaxies

- Elliptical galaxies are shaped like ellipsoids, with no spiral arms. Its number denotes its elongation where E0 is spherical and E7 is highly elongated.
- Spiral galaxies have a central bulge and spiral arms. They are classified as Sa to Sd based on the tightness of the spiral arms. Sd galaxies tend to have smaller central bulges.
- Barred spiral galaxies have a central bar and spiral arms. They are classified as SBa to SBd.
- Lenticular galaxies are a cross between elliptical and spiral galaxies. They have a central bulge, a disk of stars but no spiral arms.
- Irregular galaxies have no regular structure. These tend to be small and faint.

#### Colour
Larger galaxies are more likely to be red and smaller galaxies are more likely to be blue. 
This is because larger galaxies have used up their gas and dust to form stars, while smaller galaxies are still forming stars.

### Luminosity Function

The luminosity function is a measure of the number of galaxies at each luminosity.

$$ \Phi(L) = \frac{dN}{dL} $$
where $dN$ is the number of galaxies in a volume $dV$ and $dL$ is the luminosity interval.

$$ N = \int_0 ^\infty \Phi(L) dL $$
is the total number of galaxies in the universe.

$$ L = \int_0 ^\infty L \Phi(L) dL $$
is the total luminosity of the universe.

### Schechter Function

The Schechter function is a function that describes the luminosity function of galaxies.
$$ \phi(L) =k L^{-1} \exp(-L/L^*) $$
where k is a normalisation constant and $L^*$ is the luminosity at which the function changes slope.

For faint galaxies ($L \ll L^*$), the function $\phi(L)$ is proportional to $L^{-1}$. To find the number of galaxies at a certain luminosity, we integrate the function

$$ N = \int_0 ^{0,01L^* \phi(L) dL $$

where $0.01L^*$ is the luminosity of the faintest galaxy.

To find the total luminosity of the universe, we integrate the function
$$ L = \int_0 ^\infty L (k L^{-1} \exp(-L/L^*)) dL $$
$$ L = -k L^* \int_0 ^\infty \exp(-L/L^*) dL $$
$$ L = k L^* $$
