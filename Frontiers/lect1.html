Lecture: Scales of the Universe

---

1 astromincal unit is equal to the distance between the Sun and the Earth
$$ 1 au = 1.5 * 10 ^ 11 $$

From this distance we can find the time it takes for light to travel between the Sun and the Earth
$$ t = \frac{d}{c}$$
$$ t \approx 500s $$

The mass of the sun is called a solar mass

To calculate the angular momentum of object in the universe with
$$ L = I *  w $$
Where I is the moment of interia
$$ I = \frac{2}{5} * MR^2 $$

This is for the calculation of an objects own rotation

To calculate the angular momentum of an object rotating around a point mass we use 
$$ L = r * p $$
$$ p - m * v $$

For the luminosity of stars they fall off by an inverse sqaure law 
$$ F = \frac{L}{4*\pi*r^2} $$

Flux is the luminosity  recieved in a unit area per second
