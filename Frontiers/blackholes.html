Lecture: Black Holes

---

### AGN

Active galactic nuclei are the central region of a galaxy which is much brighter than the rest of the galaxy
The AGN intensity varies over on the timescale of days to years

This means the size of the region emitting the light must be less than the distance light can travel in a year

Most of the AGN have a broad line emission from hydrogen which implies the gas is moving at random high velocities

To calculate the mass of the AGN we can use the Virial theorem

The mass of an AGN is typically 10^6 to 10^9 solar masses and the size is typically less than a light year. This indicates the object is a super massive black hole

The AGN is very luminous because the matter falling into  the black hole is accelerated to such high velocities it heats up and emits light

The escape velocity from a black hole is the speed of light at the event horizon

### Energy 

The energy of a black hole is given by the equation $E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$

$$ L = \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{2L}{c^2}$$

For the AGN to be as bright as the whole galaxy

$$ \frac{2 \times 10^10 L_{\odot}}{c^2} = 10^20 kg/s$$

Therefore there is 10^20 kg/s of matter falling into the black hole
