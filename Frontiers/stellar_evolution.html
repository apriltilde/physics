Lecture: Stellar Evolution

---

$$ M^{3.5} = kL $$
$$ T_{main} = \frac{M}{L} = \frac{M}{M^{3.5}} = M^{2.5} $$

When a star runs out of hydrogen it starts fusing helium to form carbon. As helium has a stronger repulsive force than hydrogen the star expands.


When all sources of fusion energy are used up the core collapses, the star explodes and the outer layers are thrown off
