1) Planets travel in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus
2) The planets cover equal areas in equal time
3) $ p^2 \approx r^3 $

### Orbits

#### Circular orbits

For a circular orbit the magnitude of velocity is constant.

$$ p^2 = kr^3 $$
$$ \frac{4\pi^2r^2}{v^2} = kr^3 $$
$$ \frac{4\pi^2}{kr^2}m = m \frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$ \frac{4\pi^2}{kr^2}m = F_{grav} $$
$$ |F_{planet}| = |F_{sun}| $$

From this we can derive the gravitational constant

#### Eliptical orbits

$$ p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M + m)}a^3 $$

### Example:

$$ a = 10^14 m$$
$$ p = 5 \times 10^8 s $$
$$ m_1 + m_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{Gp^2}a^3 = 2.4 \times 10^{36} kg = 10^6 M_{sun} $$
As $m_2$ is a star almost all of the mass is in $m_2$

$m_2$ has so much mass in so little area it must be a supermassive black hole

### Virial Theorem

$$ 2 KE + Potential \ Energy = Total \ Energy$$
