Lecture: Stars

### Distances

#### Parallax

As the earth rotates around the sun the stars in the sky appear to wobble.

The angle will change by $\theta$ over the year if we measure this we can find the distance to the star

$$ \theta = \frac{1AU}{D} $$

We can use parsecs to make our lives easier

$$ D_{pc} = \frac{1}{\theta} $$
Where $\theta$ is measured in arcsecs

### Brightness

The apparent magnitude is the brightness observed on earth

$$ m = k - 2.5\log_{10}{F}$$

The absolute magnitude is the brightness as if a star was observed from 10 pc away

$$ M = k - 2.5\log_{10}{L} $$
$$ L = {4\pi r^2 F} $$
$$ M = const - 2.5\log{F} - 2.5\log{r^2} $$
$$ M = const + (m + const) - 5\log{r} $$
$$ M = const + m - 5\log{r}$$

We define the constant so that so that it holds at 10pc

$$ M = m - 5\log{\frac{D}{10pc}} $$

### Colour

We define a black body as an ideal radiator or absorber. The EM spectrum of the black body is only dependent
on a temperature $T$

Wein's law
$$ \lambda_{max} = \frac{2.9 \times 10 ^{-3}}{T} $$


We can plot the colour vs magnitude on an HR diagram
