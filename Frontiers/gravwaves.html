Lecture: Gravitational Waves

---

We can think of gravitational waves as electromagnetic waves. As a charged particle accelerating through an EM field produces a propagating wave so to a large mass accelerating through a gravitational field will produce a propagating wave


The gravitational waves cause the deformation of space time propagating at the speed of light. These deformations are very small.


To produce gravitational waves you need a large mass accelerating through a gravitational field and an asymmetrical mass distribution.


What could produce gravitational waves:

* The big bang 
* Super-massive black hole mergers
* Mergers of black holes or neutron stars
* Asymmetric supernovas
* Neutron stars with crustal asymmetries

We can calculate the time taken for a merger

$$ t = \frac{5}{256} \frac{c^5}{G^3}\frac{r^4}{(m_1m_2)(m_1 + m_2)} $$
